# CPU Simulator

## Overview

The CPU Simulator is a project designed to simulate the behavior of a CPU, allowing users to understand and visualize how various CPU components interact during instruction execution. This project can be used for educational purposes, as well as for developers looking to gain insights into CPU architecture and operation.

## Features

- Simulates various CPU architectures
- Supports a range of instruction sets
- Visual representation of CPU operation
- Step-by-step execution for debugging
- Configurable parameters for different simulation scenarios
